ALS tips:
=========


- chief dahliquist (dahliquest)?
	- ALS is just building foundations of being a NCO.
	- find a role model superviser.
	- make a decision (JUST DO IT) it will take time and you will fail.
	- airmen make mistakes, airmen dont commit crimes.
	- Airmen don't hurt other airmen (i.e) sexual assult, hazing/bullying etc...
	- also have conversations with your airman, let them know that you are there.
	- UwU we shwuld wepowrrt thuwu qwesstiwns tu pwubwic affawis UwU
	- Likeability dosent have a whole lot of play in interactions but dont be a dick.
	- If you lead by example then it will be easier to control the masses friendship...no charisma...yes
	- Leading is hard tho. Make sure to read alot of articles about the specific job you are leading.
	- Ensure you have technical knowledge to  lead effectivly.
	- UwU pweease fowcus on what thwis wing dowes UwU
	- Code 50 (manditory move) hopefully soon for Cannon, however Cannon you can start working it at 48 months.
	- Most medical family issues have to be referred to lubbock or amirillao.
	- Risk to force risk to mission...dont do that its bad.
	- Ensure the members know how to file local travel vouchers for medical referrals. 
	- WE WANT CHICK FIL-A, WE WANT TARGET
	- blah blah blah i work with dogs blah blah bla kids busy blah (i question about finding time to balance everything)
	- JUST DO IT, DONT LET YOUR DREAMS BE DREAMS but also be a part of theh airmans development
	- what are your golas? what do you want to do? why did you join the USAF? learn your Airmen 
	- Harmony is balance or else RIP "F"
	- Blah blah blah i used to be SERE, but now im a crew chief Blah blah blah (what is the selection process in beinig assigned to cannon)
	- Good luck finding someone willing to go to cannon people inherently suck and dont want to do things they dont want to  do but they do it anyways because they took that oath.
		 _cont_ I would love to find motivated people but you get what you get and you dont throw a fit.
